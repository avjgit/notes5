    for each step - List the Activity lifecycle methods that have been invoked
    on ActivityOne and on ActivityTwo, in the order they occurred.

    a1 onStart()
    a1 onResume()

    a2 onStop()

    a1 onRestart()
    a1 onStart()
    a1 onResume()

    a1 onPause()
    a1 onStop()

    a2 onRestart()

    a2 onPause()
    a2 onStop()
